			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<div class="split-left">
				<p align="justify">In the era of big data, websites are much more than just sources of content-they are real-time windows into user actions and behavior. With the increase in accessibility to the internet, traffic has gone up near exponentially. However, a lot of modern services only manage to consolidate metrics relating to user data. In a scale this large, such a vast amount of aggregated data is not really useful for a business and it seems like only the technological powerhouses have access to advanced analytics engines.</p>
				<p align="justify">Lytics, started in 2016, aims to provide a unified platform for visualizing and observing user data stemming for increasing web traffic. We make it easy for websites to look at any emerging patterns and trends that might emerge from user interaction. We provide real time snapshots for common workflows so websites don’t have to assume user behavior but can rather focus on streamlining the whole process.</p>
				<p align="justify">We understand that every website is different; they attract unique customers and provide a different experience. We also understand that in this age of big data it is essential to understand different metrics and lay out our websites in accordance with these observed patterns and trends. So let Lytics help you visualize all aspects of data metrics under a unified source and bring the power of analytics to all.</p>
